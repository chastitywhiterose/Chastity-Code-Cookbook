# Chastity's Git Repository List

I have many repositories of scatted computer programming projects. Sometimes I start projects and forget about them Other times, they grow into really awesome things. It will take some time but I decided to make a list of the most important repositories. I will list them in the order that I think is most important with a brief description.

Chastity's Code Cookbook is the main one where I work on new projects and experiment with new languages. It is also the name of a book that I have started but have yet to finish. Most of my C or Assembly code starts in this repository before it gets its own repository.

Chaste Tris is the Tetris game I made and the repository has the same version I published to Steam. Over the years I used several different media libraries such as SDL, Raylib, Allegro, and SFML. I found SDL to be the most reliable and stuck with it ever since. I have kept most of these variations, including a text based ncurses version of the game.

Chastity's Chess Chapters is the name of my Chess book which I wrote to help teach beginners. People can read the full book from the repository but a paperback and ebook version is also available on other platforms. Sadly, nobody I know personally seems to care about Chess as much as I do. I hope people learn my ways can can provide a challenge!

Minimal Markdown for Authors is a book/tutorial I wrote on how I write and publish my books using Markdown and the retailers I know about. It was this book project that made me realize I wanted to be a technical writer who educates people in how to use software to achieve their goals. Most would not believe how easy it is to write in the language of Markdown and to convert the files to various book formats for publishing

Walking the Rainbow Bridge is another book I wrote that I occasionally add to but has no set ending date. The main area of focus is on explaining LGBTQIA+ topics to normal people who don't understand, but the most important thing is to eliminate discrimination of all forms agains all races, genders, or species.

Chastehex is a program I wrote that can open a file and read or write bytes at any location from command line arguments alone. The idea was to have a hex editor that is scriptable using Bash, or other scripting languages. Mostly I use it to debug programs I cam writing or reverse engineering my favorite video games.
