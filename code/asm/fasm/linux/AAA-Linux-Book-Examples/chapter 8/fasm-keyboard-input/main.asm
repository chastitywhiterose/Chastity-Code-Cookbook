ret

;strcmp compares the string at esi to the one at edi
;eax returns 0 if the strings are the same and 1 if different
;the algorithm is simple but I will explain it for those who are confused

;eax is initialized to zero
;a byte from each string is loaded into the al and bl registers
;the bytes are compared. if they are different, then we jump to the end
;However, if they are the same, then we check if one of them is zero
;for this purpose it doesn't matter whether we compare al or bl with zero
;because it is known that they are the same if the jnz did not take place
;if it is zero, this also jumps to the end of the function
;If neither jump took place, then we jump to the start of the loop
;but when the function finally ends bl will be subtracted from al
;this ensures that the function returns zero if the final characters are the same
;ebx,esi,and edi are preserved but eax is the return value
;also, the sub instruction at the end of the function also updates the flags
;so you can "jz" or "jnz" to a label after calling this function based on results
