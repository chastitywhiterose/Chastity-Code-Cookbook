Example commands to assemble a 6502 source file named "main.asm" and output "main.bin"

Using xa (assembler from xa65 package)

xa main.asm -o main.bin

Using 64tass

64tass main.asm -o main.bin -b

The -b flag removes the starting address. The help said:
"-b, --nostart          Strip starting address"

And of course I can see the bytes generated with chastehex:

chastehex main.bin

Using ca65 (installed as part of cc65 package)

ca65 main.asm -o main.bin

It works but creates weird debug information that is not needed for me.
