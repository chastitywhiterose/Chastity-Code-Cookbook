It is not possible to disable arrow key control directly using a simple stty command. The stty command manages the terminal's line discipline settings and control characters, but arrow keys send escape sequences (e.g., Escape-[A for the up arrow) which are interpreted by the application (like a shell or editor) or the terminal emulator itself, not the core tty settings manipulated by stty. 
Understanding Arrow Key Input
Arrow keys do not have single ASCII control codes. Instead, pressing an arrow key sends a sequence of multiple characters to standard input, typically starting with an Escape character (\x1b), followed by [, and then a letter (A, B, C, or D) to indicate direction.
In normal interactive use (e.g., in a bash shell), programs that use libraries like readline (which most shells do) intercept and interpret these sequences to provide features like command history navigation or cursor movement. 
Alternative Approaches to "Disable"
The method to control how the terminal handles these sequences depends on what you are trying to achieve:
Preventing command history in the shell: You cannot easily "disable" this as it is a feature of the shell's readline library, not a tty setting.
Making a program ignore the keys: If you are writing a program, you need to handle the input within the program itself, typically by reading the raw escape sequences and ignoring them, or by using a library that handles keyboard input appropriately (like ncurses or termios).
Seeing the raw escape codes: You can use stty -icanon and stty -echo to put the terminal into "raw mode," which stops the terminal from processing input in a canonical (line-by-line) fashion and stops characters from being echoed to the screen. In this mode, you would see the raw sequences (e.g., ^[[A) if you used a basic program to print the input. Remember to run stty echo or reset afterward to restore your terminal to a usable state. 
Summary
stty cannot be used to selectively disable the interpretation of arrow keys because it manages lower-level terminal line settings, not the application-level interpretation of multi-character escape sequences. The behavior is primarily controlled by the program reading the input.
