Test of Bitwise Operations

0011 A
0101 B

0001 AND
0111 OR
0110 XOR

1110 NAND
1000 NOR
1001 XNOR

This data is for the game "Turing Complete" on Steam. I can look at the result for the 6 possible bitwise operations. This means AND,OR,XOR and also the inverted ones by the NOT operation, NAND,NOR,XNOR
