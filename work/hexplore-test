Hello World!   
I am Chastity  
This file is   
used to test   
Hexplore       
The terminal   
hex editor     
Unlike other   
hex editors    
this one does  
not use the    
ncurses or     
any external   
dependencies!  
               
Everything is  
done using     
ANSI escape    
sequences for  
Linux terminals
               
Bytes can be   
modified that  
were not part  
of the original
file but they  
will be ignored
               
This program is
Free and Open
Source Software
but is very new

at your own
risk!
