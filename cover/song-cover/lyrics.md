Chastity’s Code Cookbook

This is a story about bits and bytes
About a girl named Chastity and the code she writes
She reads reference books on her free nights
And takes her knowledge to new heights

She knows computers of new and old times
And writes programs to search for primes
Math is safe because there are no crimes
Assembling code is like writing rhymes

She wrote a book so that she can teach
Skills that only the patient will ever reach
Code is a religion that Chastity can preach
With Open Source and Freedom of Speech

Computers can Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide
Chastity trusts numbers, they have never lied
The Binary number system is used worldwide
Choose Zero or One, only you can decide

There are those who try to take our freedom away
With subscription licenses they expect us to pay
But someone like Chastity knows a much better way
How to write her own code and index each array

Chastity decided to write her books at any cost
To share her knowledge so that it won't be lost
She bought the old books before they were tossed
To avoid the technological haulocaust

You may not understand the meaning of this song
And you may think Chastity's code is wrong
Or complain that it is hundreds of lines long
But the computer says that her mind is strong

Chastity couldn't stop writing, she was on the hook
She thanked the great minds, and shared what she took
You will learn a language of numbers if you take a look
And find time to read Chastity's Code Cookbook
